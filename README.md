A drafting game about building fantasy cities

## TODO

Everything

<!--
## Import into Tabletop Simulator

Without installing, you can save [Prosperity.json][] to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\Chest\`

If installed, you can just `npm run export-to-tabletop-simulator`

In Tabletop Simulator, go to Host > Chest > Saved Objects and find Prosperity.


## Update cards

* Edit `cards.json` and preview with `index.html`
* `npm run export`
* `npm run export-to-tabletop-simulator`

<!-- When there are multiple card sets:
You can `set PARALLEL_EXPORT=ON` before running `export` to speed it up significantly **IF** it's on a powerful enough machine.
If it's not powerful enough it might freeze up the entire computer.
It needs a lot of video memory.
